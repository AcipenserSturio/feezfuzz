# Feezfuzz

## Overview

**Feezfuzz** is a parser for .fbs files for Zanzarah. The ultimate goal is streamlining modding Data files as much as possible.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 (lower versions might work, but are not tested)

* PDM (you can install it with `python -m pip install pdm`)

## Usage

Currently available scripts are work in progress - they may be clunky to use.

```
pdm install
pdm run build
```

Make sure to change the path to Zanzarah folder to whatever your path is.

## License

Feezfuzz is licensed under the MIT license.

Implemented based on [documentation from ZZdocs](https://github.com/helco/zzdocs/) and studying an [MIT-licensed parser from zzio](https://github.com/helco/zzio).
